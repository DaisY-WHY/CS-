### Core Values
To establish good preparation before the course of Computer Science officially begins, we were introduced to 3 core values that could be indeed helpful with the course. They are perseverance, persistence, and discipline. To build more connections between the core values and show a full understanding of them, we've constructed a poster, proposing the main problem "How to be Successful in Computer Science", and suggesting three sections of solution that are respectively related to the 3 core values, the 5 shared values (respect, wisdom, compassion, justice, and honesty), and the four layers of computational thinking (decomposition, pattern recognition, abstraction, and algorithmic thinking).
