## Week 1

### Core Values
To establish good preparation before the course of Computer Science officially begins, we were introduced to 3 core values that could be indeed helpful with the course. They are perseverance, persistence, and discipline. To build more connections between the core values and show a full understanding of them, we've constructed a poster, proposing the main problem "How to be Successful in Computer Science", and suggesting three sections of solution that are respectively related to the 3 core values, the 5 shared values (respect, wisdom, compassion, justice, and honesty), and the four layers of computational thinking (decomposition, pattern recognition, abstraction, and algorithmic thinking).

## Week 2
After learning the basics of the number system and data representation, an in-class test was taken as a checkpoint. The quiz includes content about RGB color, bits, hexadecimal notation, the ability to express a range of values, and other forms of data representation.

## Week 3
Functioning as a section summary, our group of three together created a poster showing all the info we've learned until now. The poster is mainly separated into two parts: number system and data types. For number system, is then categorized into three branches: denary, binary, and hexadecimal system. For the data types, it branched out into color presentation (pixels and RGB), integer, character (ASCII & Unicode), and strings.
