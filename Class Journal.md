## Week 1
***Core Value Poster***

To establish good preparation before the course of Computer Science officially begins, we were introduced to 3 core values that could be indeed helpful with the course. They are perseverance, persistence, and discipline. To build more connections between the core values and show a full understanding of them, we've constructed a poster, proposing the main problem "How to be Successful in Computer Science", and suggesting three sections of solution that are respectively related to the 3 core values, the 5 shared values (respect, wisdom, compassion, justice, and honesty), and the four layers of computational thinking (decomposition, pattern recognition, abstraction, and algorithmic thinking).

## Week 2
***Testing Understanding of Number System and Data Presentation***

After learning the basics of the number system and data representation, an in-class test was taken as a checkpoint. The quiz includes content about RGB color, bits, hexadecimal notation, the ability to express a range of values, and other forms of data representation.

## Week 3
***CHAPTER SUMMARY —— Number System and Data Type***

Functioning as a section summary, our group of three created a poster together showing all the info we've learned so far. The poster is mainly separated into two parts: number system and data types. The number system is then categorized into three branches: denary, binary, and hexadecimal system. For the data types, it branches out into color presentation (pixels and RGB), integer, character (ASCII & Unicode), and strings.

## Week 6
***Binary Tree Inclass Practice***

In this class, we've learned about the concept of a binary tree, which is a data structure with one node on the top, then separating into different nodes with a link/branch. To traverse the binary tree, three ways are suggested, they are respectively Pre-order, In-order, and Post-order. Pre-order of tree traversal means that a "flag" is inserted at the left of the node, and the order of value stored in the node is then determined by the sequence of a line - that starts from the left of the root node and traces the contour line of the binary tree and eventually return to the right of the root node - that touches the flag. In-order means the flag is inserted at the bottom of each node, and post-order means the location of the flag is at the right side of each node.

When learning about the notation of the binary tree operation - especially Infix notation - we were given three operation statements and were required to transform the requirement into a corresponding binary tree. The basic idea of Infix notation is to take the middle operator (calculation signs) and turn it into the root node. Then, the root node will develop the left subtree and the right subtree correspondingly with the given operation (the number in the operation is known as the operands).

To comprehensively understand the binary tree operation, we have also practiced another form, which is the Post-fix calculation. Differing from the In-fix calculation where all the operators are located in between the operands, the Post-fix calculation's operators are all used to calculate the two operands before the operator (see image below). In any form of calculation, the left-hand side will always be placed in the front of an operation.

In terms of the Binary Search Tree (BST), the first value in a list is always considered to be the root node. The second value in the list will then compare with the root node: if larger, goes to the right; if smaller, goes to the left. When the third value will then be compared with the first and the second value (if the third value is on the same side as the second value).
