# Number Systems
## Denary/Decimal System
- A base 10 number system, using digits from 0 to 9.
-	Numbers in the Decimal System are built using a power of 10, each digit represents a specific place value.

## Binary System
-	A Base 2 number system, using only 0 and 1.
-	Two states: on/off or true/false - 0 as off/false, 1 as on/true.

### Bits and Bytes
**BIT**: Binary digits - the **smallest unit of data**
-	A bit holds two values: 0 and 1 (the foundation of all computer operations.)
-	The number of bits in a word determines the word length of the computer, but it is usually a **multiple of 8**.
-	The number of bits represents the amount a computer CPU can process at a time (every millisecond)
-	**bps**: bits per second - speed
-	**MB**: storage

**Byte**: 8 bits make one byte
- one byte represents 256 different values, ranging from 0 to 255 in decimal.

### Two's Complement
Signed-magnitude number representation. It is applied using binary format when one must represent a **negative number**.

***The procedure of Two's Complement:***

For instance - to represent the value of -68

1. Represent the absolute value of -68 in binary
2. Inverse the location of all the 1s and the 0s
3. Add 1 to the first value
- The resulting binary digits show how the negative number will be presented
**To Verify:** Calculate the value of the first 7 digits, then -128 to see if the value is -68.

## Hexadecimal System
- Base 16 number system, using digits 0 - 9 and A - F (A as 10 and F as 15)
-	Each hexadecimal digit represents/stores four binary digits:
